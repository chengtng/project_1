# ! Project 1: Exploring weather data in Singapore to save energy consumption for air-conditioning in building facilities management

### Problem Statement

> * As a building facilities management company, we are looking to reduce our energy consumption for air-conditioning. This project aims to analyse the monthly weather patterns over the year to allow the operations team to better plan and allocate air-conditioning resources.

### Datasets

#### Provided Data

There are 2 datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. These correponds to rainfall information. 

* [`rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days.csv`](./data/rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days.csv): Monthly number of rain days from 1982 to 2022. A day is considered to have “rained” if the total rainfall for that day is 0.2mm or more.
* [`rainfall-monthly-total.csv`](./data/rainfall-monthly-total.csv): Monthly total rain recorded in mm(millimeters) from 1982 to 2022

Other relevant weather datasets from [data.gov.sg](data.gov.sg):

* [Relative Humidity](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/relative-humidity-monthly-mean)
* [Monthly Maximum Daily Rainfall](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/rainfall-monthly-maximum-daily-total)
* [Hourly wet bulb temperature](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/wet-bulb-temperature-hourly)
* [Monthly mean sunshine hours](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/sunshine-duration-monthly-mean-daily-duration)
* [Surface Air Temperature](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/surface-air-temperature-mean-daily-minimum)
