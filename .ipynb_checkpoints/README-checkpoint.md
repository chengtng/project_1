# Project 1: Data Analysis of Singapore Weather And Energy Consumption

### Problem Statement

* As a building facilities management company, we are looking to reduce our energy consumption for air-conditioning. This project aims to analyse the monthly weather patterns over the year to allow the operations team to better plan and allocate air-conditioning resources.

### Datasets
#### Main Data 
* [Monthly Number of Rain Days](./data/rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days.csv): <br>
Monthly number of rain days from 1982 to 2022. A day is considered to have “rained” if the total rainfall for that day is 0.2mm or more.
* [Total Monthly Rainfall](./data/rainfall-monthly-total.csv): <br>
Monthly total rain recorded in mm(millimeters) from 1982 to 2022
* [Relative Humidity](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/relative-humidity-monthly-mean): <br>
Mean relative humidity aggregated monthly from 1982 to 2022 in percentage.
* [Monthly Maximum Daily Rainfall](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/rainfall-monthly-maximum-daily-total): <br>
Maximum daily rainfall aggregated monthly from 1982 to 2022 in mm.
* [Hourly wet bulb temperature](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/wet-bulb-temperature-hourly): <br>
Wet bulb temperature every hour from 1982 to 2022 in (°C).
* [Monthly mean sunshine hours](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/sunshine-duration-monthly-mean-daily-duration): <br>
Mean sunshine hours per day aggregated monthly from 1982 to 2022 in hours.
* [Surface Air Temperature](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/surface-air-temperature-mean-daily-minimum): <br>
Surface Air temperature aggregated monthly from 1982 to 2022 in (°C).

#### Additional Data
* [Household Energy Consumption](https://www.ema.gov.sg/statistic.aspx?sta_sid=20140617E32XNb1d0Iqa): <br>
Energy consumption for households aggregated monthly in kWh from 2005 to 2020.
